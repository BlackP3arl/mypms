### 💎 Feature Highlight
```
Why we built MyPMS differently:

Most task managers force you to:
❌ Create an account
❌ Pay monthly fees
❌ Trust them with your data
❌ Learn complex features

MyPMS:
✅ Works instantly
✅ Free forever
✅ Local storage
✅ Dead simple

Task management, reimagined.

### Question Tweet #1
```
Quick poll 🤔

What kills your productivity the most?

A) Too many meetings
B) Notification overload
C) Unclear priorities
D) Bad tools

(We built MyPMS to fix D)
```

### Question Tweet #2
```
Honest question:

Do you actually need a $15/month project management tool with 100 features you never use?

Or would a beautiful, simple Kanban board solve 90% of your problems for $0?

Just curious 🤷‍♂️

### Comparison Tweet
```
MyPMS vs. Other Tools

Setup time:
Them: 30 minutes ⏰
Us: 0 seconds ⚡

Monthly cost:
Them: $9-25 💸
Us: $0 forever 🎉

Your data:
Them: Our servers ☁️
Us: Your device 🔒

Learning curve:
Them: Steep 📈
Us: Instant 🚀

Choose wisely.
```

### Behind-the-Scenes
```
Building in public 🛠️

We made MyPMS because we were frustrated with:

• Sign-up fatigue
• Subscription overload
• Privacy concerns
• Feature bloat

So we built what we wanted: beautifully simple task management.

No BS. Just tasks.

## Thread Series

### 🧵 Thread #1: Why Local-First Matters
```
Tweet 1/6

Why MyPMS stores your data locally (and why it matters) 🧵👇

Most productivity apps store your tasks on their servers. Here's why we didn't do that:
```

```
Tweet 2/6

1. PRIVACY 🔒

Your tasks are personal. To-do lists reveal your work, habits, even your mental state.

With MyPMS, your data never leaves your device. No one can access it, sell it, or leak it.
```

```
Tweet 3/6

2. SPEED ⚡

Local storage = instant performance.

No loading spinners. No "syncing..." messages. No lag.

Drag-and-drop feels *instant* because it IS instant.
```

```
Tweet 4/6

3. OFFLINE ACCESS 📴

Plane? Coffee shop with bad WiFi? No problem.

MyPMS works 100% offline. Always.

Your productivity doesn't depend on an internet connection.
```

```
Tweet 5/6

4. OWNERSHIP 💎

It's YOUR data.

No terms of service that change overnight. No company that might shut down. No paywall that locks you out.

You own your tasks. Forever.
```

```
Tweet 6/6

5. SIMPLICITY 🎯

No servers = no complexity.

No authentication. No password resets. No "verify your email."

Just open. Use. Done.

What matters most to you: privacy, speed, or ownership?
```

### 🧵 Thread #2: Productivity Philosophy
```
Tweet 1/5

The best productivity tool is the one you actually use. 🧵

Here's our philosophy behind MyPMS:
```

```
Tweet 2/5

1. ZERO FRICTION

If it takes 15 minutes to set up, you'll procrastinate setting it up.

MyPMS works in 0 seconds. Open → Start organizing.

No excuses. No setup tax.
```

```
Tweet 3/5

2. VISUAL THINKING

Text lists don't show you the big picture.

Kanban boards do. See your workflow. Spot bottlenecks. Feel progress.

Your brain processes visual information 60,000x faster than text.
```

```
Tweet 4/5

3. SATISFYING INTERACTIONS

Productivity tools should feel GOOD to use.

Smooth drag-and-drop. Gentle animations. Instant feedback.

We made every interaction delightful because motivation matters.
```

```
Tweet 5/5

4. NO DISTRACTIONS

No notifications. No social features. No gamification.

Just you, your tasks, and pure focus.

"The best project management tool is the one that gets out of your way."

That's why we built MyPMS.

```
Stop paying monthly subscriptions for task management.

MyPMS is free, beautiful, and works instantly.

Your move. [link]
```

```
Task management in 2025 shouldn't require:
• Creating an account
• Entering a credit card
• Reading documentation
• Watching tutorials

MyPMS: Open. Drag. Drop. Done. [link]
```

```
Privacy isn't a feature.

It's a right.

MyPMS stores everything locally. No clouds. No servers. No tracking.

Your tasks are yours. [link]

```
The only subscription you need is the one to your own discipline.

## Viral Hook Attempts

### Hook #1: Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion:

You don't need a project management tool with Gantt charts, time tracking, and 47 integrations.

You need a Kanban board.

That's it.

MyPMS proves it → [link]
```

### Hook #2: Pain Point
```
You: "I need to get organized"

Also you: *spends 2 hours researching which $15/month tool to use*

Just use MyPMS. It's free. It works now. No research paralysis.

[link]
```

### Hook #3: Before/After
```
Me before MyPMS:
• Tasks scattered across 5 apps
• Paying $30/month for "premium" features I never use
• Constantly context switching

Me after MyPMS:
• One beautiful board
• $0/month
• Just drag and drop

Simple works. [link]
```

### Hook #4: Social Proof Setup (for future)
```
We launched MyPMS 30 days ago.

Results:
• 5,000+ users
• 500+ GitHub stars
• Featured on Product Hunt
• $0 spent on ads

How? We built something people actually want.

Free. Private. Beautiful.

### When someone asks about mobile app:
```
Great question! Currently web-based (works on mobile browsers), but we're exploring a PWA and native app based on feedback.

What features would be must-haves for you in a mobile version?
```

### When someone asks about team collaboration:
```
Right now MyPMS is perfect for individual use or small teams sharing a device/screen.

Cloud sync & real-time collaboration is on the roadmap!

What's your #1 collab feature request?
```

### When someone compares to Trello:
```
Love Trello! MyPMS is similar but:
• No account needed
• Stores locally (privacy)
• Free forever
• Faster & lighter

Think of us as "Trello for privacy-conscious minimalists" 😊
