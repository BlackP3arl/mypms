## 📧 Email #2: Onboarding Series (Day 1)

**Subject:** "Welcome to MyPMS! Here's how to get started"

**Preview Text:** "3 quick tips to master your new Kanban board"

**Email Body (Plain Text Version):**

```
Hi [Name],

Welcome to MyPMS! 🎉

You've just discovered the simplest way to organize your tasks. Here's how to make the most of it:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 TIP #1: CREATE YOUR WORKFLOW

The default columns are "To Do", "In Progress", and "Completed" – but you can create any workflow you want:

• Content creators: Ideas → Drafting → Editing → Published
• Developers: Backlog → Doing → Review → Done
• Students: Assigned → Working → Review → Submitted

Click "Add Column" and make MyPMS work YOUR way.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎨 TIP #2: USE COLOR CODING

Click the edit icon on any column to choose from 8 beautiful colors:

🔵 Blue for urgent tasks
🟢 Green for completed projects
🟡 Yellow for ideas and brainstorms
🔴 Red for blockers

Visual organization = instant clarity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ TIP #3: DRAG & DROP EVERYTHING

No clicking through menus. Just grab and drag:

• Drag tasks between columns to change status
• Drag within a column to reorder by priority
• Enjoy the smooth animations (we made them extra satisfying)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 PRO TIP: Your data is automatically saved to your browser's local storage. No sync, no cloud – it just works.

Happy organizing!

## 📧 Email #3: Onboarding Series (Day 3)

**Subject:** "5 productivity frameworks to try in MyPMS"

**Preview Text:** "From GTD to Pomodoro – organize any way you want"

**Email Body:**

```
Hey there,

Now that you're getting comfortable with MyPMS, let's explore how to use it with popular productivity frameworks:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 1. GETTING THINGS DONE (GTD)

Columns:
• Inbox → Next Actions → Waiting → Someday/Maybe → Done

How it works: Capture everything in Inbox, then organize into actionable tasks. Move to "Next Actions" when ready to work on them.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⏱️ 2. POMODORO TECHNIQUE

Columns:
• Today's Tasks → Focus (25 min) → Break → Completed

How it works: Drag 4-6 tasks to "Today's Tasks". Move ONE to "Focus" and work for 25 minutes. Then to "Break" (5 min). Repeat.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 3. EISENHOWER MATRIX

Columns:
• Urgent & Important → Important, Not Urgent → Delegate → Delete

How it works: Color code by urgency. Focus on green (Important, Not Urgent) to prevent fires.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 4. AGILE/SCRUM (2-WEEK SPRINTS)

Columns:
• Backlog → Sprint (In Progress) → Review → Done

How it works: Plan your sprint (2 weeks). Move top priorities from Backlog to Sprint. Review what got done at the end.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📅 5. PERSONAL KANBAN (OUR FAVORITE)

Columns:
• Options → Today (WIP Limit: 3) → Done

How it works: Limit "Today" to 3 tasks max. Only add new tasks when you complete one. Prevents overwhelm.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

P.S. You can edit column names anytime. Start with one framework and adjust as you learn what works for you.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 TASK DESCRIPTIONS

Click any task to add detailed notes:
• Meeting agenda items
• Links to resources

Perfect for capturing details without cluttering your board.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💾 AUTOMATIC SAVING

Your board auto-saves to your browser's local storage. No manual saving needed.
